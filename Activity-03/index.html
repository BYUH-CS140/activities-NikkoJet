                <p>"How to Hug a Porcupine" by Debbie Ellis is a self-help book that <ul><mark>uses the analogy of a porcupine to illustrate how to deal with difficult people in your life.</mark></ul></p>
                <p>The book suggests that by understanding the "porcupine's" (i.e., the difficult person's) fears and motivations, you can approach them with patience, empathy, and kindness, rather than escalating conflict.</p>
                <p>The analogy encourages readers to recognize and respect the boundaries of these individuals, and to find ways to connect with their soft spots, ultimately promoting peaceful interactions.</p>
