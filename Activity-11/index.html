        <h2>Aloha! My name is <strong>Nikko</strong>. I'm 23 years old and I'm from the Philippines.</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to help you get to know more about me, where I came from, my favorite book, and how to make my favorite food.</p>
        <p>I am a student here in <strong>Brigham Young University–Hawaii</strong>, majoring in Computer Science, and I’m taking Visual Arts and Entrepreneurship as my minors.</p>
        <p>Growing up, art was one of the things I loved doing. I had a passion to become both an architect and engineer. In fact, I studied Architecture at the University of the Philippines–Diliman, one of the top universities in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>When I got here, I pursued my love for Computer Science. Even though the majors are different, the purpose remains the same.</p>

      <p>Hello! I’m Nikko. This is a floated image section with text wrapping around my photo. I enjoy combining creativity and technology in all that I do. Whether it’s designing a web page or illustrating on paper, expression is my favorite form of communication.</p>
      <p>Studying in BYU–Hawaii has been a blessing. It helped me appreciate both my Filipino roots and the international opportunities I now have. Through coding and design, I want to inspire others to build, create, and share goodness in the world.</p>
